# 3. Calculate Employee Bonus. Write a Python program to calculate an
# employee's bonus based on their basic salary and years of service:
#    Less than 2 years: 5% of basic salary
#    2 to 5 years: 10% of basic salary
#    6 to 10 years: 15% of basic salary
#    More than 10 years: 20% of basic salary
# Calculate and display: Basic Salary , Bonus , Gross Salary = Basic Salary + Bonus
